          <p>I developed LendKey’s first modern single page apps, using React, Typescript, and Redux. In partnership with our UX director, I implemented a library of reusable user interface components browsable in Storybook. I managed and mentored two junior frontend engineers.</p>

          <p>I led “small and mighty” teams made up of software engineers, QA engineers, and product owners. With LendKey’s goal of “improving lives with lending made simple” always in mind, I worked closely with the leadership and product
            teams to plan, estimate, design, implement, and deploy new features and products. For example, I designed and led the team that implemented a highly-flexible API to evaluate predictive models that has been used to decision and price millions of dollars worth of loans. At the same time, I worked towards company-wide engineering and architectural goals
            by helping split a monolithic application into micro-services and select new languages and frameworks. I led sprint ceremonies like scrums, demos, retrospectives, and refinement sessions. I demoed to the board of directors and wrote <a href="https://medium.com/lendgineering/building-flexible-credit-decisioning-for-an-expanded-credit-box-54dc626914b4">blog posts</a> about out work.</p>

          <p>I worked with a talented team of engineers and subject-matter experts to create and maintain a massive lending-as-a-service platform used by hundreds of credit unions and banks to enable over 30,000
            consumers to save money on student, consolidation, and home improvement loans. I was instrumental in implementing features like staged loan funding and a bureau-agnostic credit pulling
            micro-service. I improved my Ruby on Rails skills, learned a lot about the fintech world, and gained valuable experience working on a cross-functional agile team– doing everything from writing user stories to leading demos. As the number of engineers
            grew, I led the effort to implement test coverage, style, and documentation standards and integrate them into our CI/CD pipeline.</p>

          <p>I joined DDB, Interbrand’s parent company, as part of an IT consolidation. I used my agency experience to create websites and software tools optimized for that environment. I utilized Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design. I created
            powerful, easy-to-use, and on-brand <a href="http://portfolio.mooserific.org/">projects</a>, including digital asset managers, workflow tools, and marketing websites using Ruby on Rails.</p>

          <p>As the manager of a two-person IT department for the Cincinnati office of an international design agency, I was responsible for every aspect of the office’s technology. I maintained an excellent rapport with my co-workers and was seen as a valued
            partner— I was twice presented with an employee of the year award by my peers. I also worked with Interbrand’s IT leadership around the world to accomplish projects for the benefit of the entire company. In addition, I served as a software
            and web developer for our office, creating several widely-used tools including an internal web application capable of handling everything from vacation scheduling to inventory tracking, a digital asset management system which won a global
            Interbrand Best Work award, a variety of marketing websites and billable client projects.</p>
