          <p>In concert with a product owner, I led a “small and mighty” team made up of software engineers, a QA engineer, and a business analyst. With the company’s goal of “making lending simple” always in mind, I worked closely with LendKey’s leadership
            and product team to plan, estimate, and implement new features, like easily-configurable credit risk analysis and loan decisioning. At the same time, I worked with my peers on other teams to plan and accomplish engineering and architectural
            goals, like splitting a giant monolithic application into micro-services and selecting new programming languages and frameworks. I served the other engineers on my team by removing barriers to their productivity and offering advice on both
            code and career development. I led sprint ceremonies like scrums, demos, retrospectives, and refinement sessions.</p>

          <p>I worked with a talented team of engineers, subject-matter experts, and designers to create and maintain a large, high-traffic, and highly-scalable lending-as-a-service platform used by hundreds of credit unions and banks to enable over 30,000
            consumers to save money on student, consolidation, and home improvement loans. I helped to support a very large and complicated codebase and was instrumental in implementing features like staged loan funding and a bureau-agnostic credit pulling
            micro-service. I improved my Ruby on Rails skills, learned a lot about finance, and gained valuable experience working on a cross-functional agile team– doing everything from writing user stories to leading demos. As the number of engineers
            grew, I led the effort to implement coding style and documentation standards and integrate their enforcement into our CI/CD pipeline.</p>

          <p>I joined DDB, Interbrand’s parent company, as part of an IT consolidation. I used my agency experience to create websites and software tools optimized for that environment. I utilized Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design. I created
            powerful, easy-to-use, and attractive <a href="http://portfolio.mooserific.org/">projects</a>, including digital asset managers, workflow tools, and marketing websites using Ruby on Rails.</p>

          <p>As the manager of a two-person IT department for the Cincinnati office of an international design agency, I was responsible for every aspect of the office’s technology. I maintained an excellent rapport with my co-workers and was seen as a valued
            partner— I was twice presented with an employee of the year award by my peers. I also worked with Interbrand’s IT leadership around the world to accomplish projects for the benefit of the entire company. In addition, I served as a software
            and web developer for our office, creating several widely-used tools including an internal web application capable of handling everything from vacation scheduling to inventory tracking, a digital asset management system which won a global
